      "Individual income tax is a levy imposed by governments on individuals' financial earnings, including wages, salaries, dividends, interest, and rents. It is typically progressive, meaning higher income levels are taxed at higher rates. Taxpayers must file annual returns, usually by April 15th in the U.S., choosing a filing status that affects their tax rates and eligibility for deductions and credits. Employers often withhold taxes from paychecks, but self-employed individuals may need to make estimated payments. Tax authorities ensure compliance and may conduct audits or impose penalties for underpayment or fraud.",

      "Business income tax is a tax imposed on the earnings of businesses, which can include corporations, partnerships, and sole proprietorships. The tax is calculated based on the business's net income, which is the total revenue minus allowable expenses such as cost of goods sold, salaries, rent, and other operational costs. Different business structures face varying tax rates and rules. Corporations are typically taxed separately from their owners, while income from sole proprietorships and partnerships is usually passed through to the owners and taxed at their individual rates. Compliance involves filing annual tax returns, paying estimated taxes quarterly, and adhering to tax regulations to avoid penalties and audits.",
